# QA Plan

## Scope

Verify the layered governance contract between `server-development-consensus`
and the `afk-bootstrap` execution adapter. This plan covers the policy adapter,
version compatibility, credential boundary, and structured exceptions; it does
not claim that the future portable checker is implemented by this documentation
change.

## Cases

| ID | Environment | Preconditions | Test data | Actions | Expected observable result | Cleanup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GOV-B01 | AFK consumer repository | Adapter and consensus metadata are present | A rule that weakens the baseline | Run the adapter preflight | Preflight fails and reports the conflicting invariant | Restore test metadata |
| GOV-B02 | AFK consumer repository | CI has the compatibility validator | Current consensus outside the declared SemVer range | Run the implementation/delivery check | Check fails with both versions and no push is attempted | Restore test metadata |
| GOV-B03 | Docker agent plus host runner | Container, host wrapper, and GitHub Ruleset are available | Attempted `git push origin main` | Execute the push path at each boundary | Container check, host wrapper, and Ruleset each reject the operation | Remove temporary branch |
| GOV-B04 | AFK consumer repository | Exception validator is enabled | One valid and one expired structured exception | Run the exception check | Valid implementation exception is accepted; expired or security-boundary exception blocks delivery | Remove temporary exception records |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Feature scenario | QA case |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline precedence | An AFK adapter cannot weaken a server invariant | GOV-B01 |
| Compatibility blocking | An incompatible AFK template is blocked | GOV-B02 |
| Three-layer default-branch protection | A container cannot deliver directly to the default branch | GOV-B03 |
| Bounded exceptions | A legitimate AFK implementation difference is recorded | GOV-B04 |

## Risk Checks

- Complexity/coverage: not applicable to this documentation-only decision; the
  future checker is a separate implementation change with its own evidence.
- Mutation testing: not applicable; no business rule, authorization code, or
  persistence implementation changes in this decision record.

## Execution Status

Status: planned. The scenarios are the acceptance contract for the follow-up
portable checker, compatibility validator, and exception validator. They are
not reported as passed until those components exist and retain their logs or
report artifacts.
